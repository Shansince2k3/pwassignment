    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that allows us to update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence.

Bayes's theorem is especially useful in situations where we have prior knowledge or beliefs about the event we are interested in.\n",

    "Using Bayes's theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[P(Disease X | Positive Test) = \\frac{P(Positive Test | Disease X) * P(Disease X)}{P(Positive Test)}]$\n",

    "A confidence interval is a range of values calculated from sample data that is likely to contain the true population parameter of interest, such as a population mean or proportion, with a certain level of confidence. In other words, it provides an interval estimate for the population parameter along with a statement about the level of confidence in the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical confidence interval is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ \\text{Point Estimate} \\pm \\text{Margin of Error} ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"Point Estimate\" is the sample statistic that serves as our best guess for the population parameter. For example, the sample mean (x̄) is often used as a point estimate for the population mean (μ).\n",

    "- The \"Margin of Error\" is a range that accounts for the variability and uncertainty in the sample data. It is typically calculated using a critical value from a probability distribution (e.g., the t-distribution or z-distribution) and the standard error of the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a confidence level (e.g., 95%, 99%, etc.). This represents the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the appropriate probability distribution and critical value(s) associated with the chosen confidence level. For example, for a 95% confidence interval with a normal distribution, you might use a critical value of 1.96.\n",

    "3. Calculate the point estimate using your sample data. For example, if you are estimating the population mean, calculate the sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the standard error of the sample statistic, which depends on the sample size and the population parameter you are estimating.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the margin of error by multiplying the standard error by the critical value from step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Construct the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error from the point estimate.\n",

    "Suppose you want to estimate the average height of adult males in a certain city. You take a random sample of 100 adult males and measure their heights.

    "\n",
    "1. Choose a 95% confidence level.\n",

    "2. Because you have a sample size of 100, you can approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean as a normal distribution. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval with a normal distribution is 1.96 (you can find this value from a standard normal distribution table or calculator).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The point estimate is the sample mean, which is 175 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the standard error: $(SE = \\frac{\\text{Sample Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Sample Size}}} = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt{100}} = 0.6)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the margin of error: $(ME = \\text{Critical Value} \\times SE = 1.96 \\times 0.6 = 1.176)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Construct the 95% confidence interval: \\(175 \\pm 1.176\\), which gives you the interval (173.824, 176.176).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can be 95% confident that the true average height of adult males in the city falls within the range of 173.824 cm to 176.176 cm based on your sample data."

    "# Q14. In a study of the effects of caffeine on reaction time, a sample of 30 participants had an average reaction time of 0.25 seconds with a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level using a t-test."

    "**Step 1: Define the Null Hypothesis (H0) and Alternative Hypothesis (H1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): Caffeine has no significant effect on reaction time; the mean reaction time with caffeine ($(\\mu$)) is equal to the mean reaction time without caffeine ($(mu_0$)). In mathematical terms, H0: $(\\mu = \\mu_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time; the mean reaction time with caffeine ($(\\mu$)) is not equal to the mean reaction time without caffeine ($(mu_0$)). In mathematical terms, H1: $(\\mu \\neq \\mu_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a two-tailed test because you want to test if there is any difference, either positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Set the Significance Level (\\(\\alpha\\)):**\n",
    "\n",
    "You've mentioned a significance level of 90%, so $(\\alpha = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10)$. This represents the probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Collect Data and Calculate Test Statistic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the following data for the sample:\n",
    "- Sample Mean ($(\\bar{X}$)) = 0.25 seconds\n",
    "- Sample Standard Deviation ($(s$)) = 0.05 seconds\n",
    "- Sample Size ($(n)$) = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, calculate the test statistic (t-statistic) using the formula for a one-sample t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ t = \\frac{(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}} ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$[ t = \\frac{(0.25 - \\mu_0)}{\\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{30}}} ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Find the Degrees of Freedom and Critical Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-sample t-test, degrees of freedom (df) is equal to ($(n - 1)$). In this case, df = 30 - 1 = 29.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to find the critical t-value(s) based on the significance level ($(\\alpha/2$)) and degrees of freedom (df). Since it's a two-tailed test, you'll find the critical values for $(\\alpha/2 = 0.10/2 = 0.05$) in both tails. You can use a t-table or calculator to find these critical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Compare the Test Statistic and Critical Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-values. If the absolute value of the t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value(s), you can reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Make a Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the test results, make a conclusion about whether caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time.\n",
